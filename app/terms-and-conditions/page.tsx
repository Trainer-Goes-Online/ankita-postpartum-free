      <h2>3. Medical Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>The Program is provided for educational and informational purposes only. It is <strong>not medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment</strong>. The postpartum period is a unique medical state and individual recovery timelines vary widely. You must consult your obstetrician, gynaecologist, or qualified healthcare provider before beginning any exercise program — especially if you are less than 6 weeks postpartum, have had a Caesarean section, are still experiencing significant lochia (bleeding), have a wide or symptomatic diastasis recti, pelvic organ prolapse symptoms, severe pelvic or back pain, postpartum hypertension, post-surgical complications, or any concern raised by your doctor.</p>
      <p>If you experience pain, dizziness, heavy bleeding, urinary or faecal leakage, a feeling of heaviness or bulging in the pelvic floor, or any unusual symptom during or after a session, stop immediately and seek medical care.</p>

      <h2>4. Eligibility</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You must be at least 18 years old.</li>
        <li>You must be currently in your postpartum stage (typically 6 weeks or more after delivery, or as cleared by your doctor).</li>
        <li>You must have clearance from your treating physician before participating in any movement portion of the Program.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Registration &amp; Access</h2>
      <p>The Program is offered <strong>free of charge</strong> — no payment is required to register or attend. Access details (Zoom links, community group access, session materials) are shared via WhatsApp within minutes of completing the registration form.</p>
      <p>BodyWorx may change the Program format, timings, or offer terms at any time. Any such changes will not affect participants already registered.</p>

      <h2>6. Refunds</h2>
      <p>Because the Program is provided at no cost, there is no refund policy — nothing has been charged, so nothing can be refunded. You are free to disengage from the Program at any time.</p>

      <h2>7. Your Responsibilities</h2>
